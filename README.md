A site generator inspired by [forester](https://www.forester-notes.org/index/index.xml), but means to be a [finished software](https://josem.co/the-beauty-of-finished-software/), which means this project will try to don't add new feature, and shall not break old articles as possible as it can.

Read https://tr-notes.srht.site for more information, the raco package page is https://pkgs.racket-lang.org/package/tr.
