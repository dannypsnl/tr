A site generator inspired by [forester](https://www.forester-notes.org/index/index.xml), but means to be a [finished software](https://josem.co/the-beauty-of-finished-software/), which means this project will try to don't add new feature, and shall not break old articles as possible as it can.

The way to use this project is
1. fork it
2. update content as you want
3. add any customization you want, this would need you understand racket and scribble
